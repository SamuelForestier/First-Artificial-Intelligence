## Case Study

For this first experiment we will imagine a small case study. 
I have several objects and I decide to classify them according to their color, blue or red, and of course I took the time to note their length and width.

| red | blue | red | blue | red | blue | red | blue | unknown | 
|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|---------|
| 3   | 2    | 4   | 3    | 3.5 | 2    | 5.5 | 1    | 4.5     |
| 1.5 | 1    | 1.5 | 1    | 0.5 | 0.2  | 1   | 1    | 1       |

However, it seems that I forgot to note the color of the last object and I only have its length and width.
So I'm going to create an artificial intelligence that will allow me to find the color of my object.
